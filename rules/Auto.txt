Autonomous Rule A01 ü§ñ Behind the lines. ü§ñ During AUTO, DRIVE TEAM members in ALLIANCE STATIONS and LOADING LANES may not contact anything in front of the STARTING LINES, unless for personal or equipment safety. ü§ñ Violation: FOUL. ü§ñ Pointing, gesturing or otherwise extending across the STARTING LINE such that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements is not a violation of this rule. One example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE starts to slide from the PLAYER STATION shelf. In that circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it and return it. However, if an OPERATOR CONSOLE has already hit the ground, the damage has already been done, and touching it before TELEOP starts is not an exception for equipment safety.
Autonomous Rule A02 ü§ñ During AUTO, let the ROBOT do its thing. ü§ñ During AUTO, DRIVE TEAMS may not directly or indirectly interact with ROBOTS or OPERATOR CONSOLES unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or pressing an E-Stop for ROBOT safety. ü§ñ Violation: FOUL and YELLOW CARD.
Autonomous Rule A03 ü§ñ Disconnect or set down controllers. ü§ñ During AUTO, any control devices worn or held by the DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS must be disconnected from the OPERATOR CONSOLE. ü§ñ Violation: FOUL.
Autonomous Rule A04 ü§ñ Stay out of your opponent's LAUNCHPAD. ü§ñ During AUTO, no part of a ROBOT'S BUMPERS may enter their opponent's LAUNCHPAD. ü§ñ Violation: FOUL. If contact is made with an opponent ROBOT in their LAUNCHPAD (either direct contact or transitive contact through another object), TECH FOUL.
Autonomous Rule A05 ü§ñ PILOTS: don't take the ‚Äúfree‚Äù GEAR yet. ü§ñ During AUTO, PILOTS may not remove the reserve GEAR from the slot in which it begins the MATCH. ü§ñ Violation: TECH FOUL.
