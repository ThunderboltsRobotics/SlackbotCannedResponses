AIRSHIP ðŸ¤– A structure that features an elevated hexagonal deck, slanted walls, rails with AXLES to mount GEARS, four ROTORS, three LIFTS, a STEAM TANK, and three ROPES attached to DAVITS.
ALLIANCE ðŸ¤– a cooperative of up to four FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition Teams.
ALLIANCE CAPTAIN ðŸ¤– The designated student representative from each ALLIANCE in a Playoff MATCH.
ALLIANCE STATION ðŸ¤– an 8' 9Â¾" (~269 cm) by 23' 1Â½" (~705 cm) infinitely tall volume bounded by the ALLIANCE WALL and ALLIANCE colored tape.
ALLIANCE WALL ðŸ¤– the physical structure that separates ROBOTS from DRIVE TEAMS (except the PILOT) and consists of a BOILER, three PLAYER STATIONS, an Overflow LOADING STATION and a Return LOADING STATION.
ARENA ðŸ¤– all elements and areas of the game infrastructure that are required to play FIRST STEAMWORKSâ„ : the FIELD, AIRSHIPS, carpet, scoring elements, and all equipment and areas needed for FIELD control, ROBOT control, and scorekeeping.
ARENA FAULT ðŸ¤– an error in ARENA operation that includes, but aren't limited to those listed in Section 10.8 MATCH Replays.
AUTO ðŸ¤– the first fifteen seconds of a MATCH in which ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE TEAM control or input.
AXLE ðŸ¤– a â…ž" diameter (~2 cm), 2" (~5 cm) long shaft which fits the central hub of a GEAR. AXLES are installed on the RAIL of the AIRSHIP.
BACKUP TEAM ðŸ¤– The Team whose ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES.
BANNER ðŸ¤– a Team's flag to be displayed on their PLAYER STATION during MATCHES.
BASE LINE ðŸ¤– a green line that spans the width of the FIELD and is 9â…“' (~284 cm) from the ALLIANCE WALL diamond plate.
BOILER ðŸ¤– a FIELD element which converts FUEL to steam. There is a BOILER on each corner of the FIELD opposite the scoring table. The base of each BOILER is 3Â½' wide (~107 cm) by 3Â½' (~107 cm) deep by 8' 1" (~246 cm) tall. There are two openings, or GOALS, for loading FUEL into the BOILER: the High Efficiency GOAL and the Low Efficiency.
BUMPER ðŸ¤– a required assembly which attaches to the ROBOT frame. BUMPERS are important because they protect ROBOTS from damaging / being damaged by other ROBOTS and FIELD elements.
BUMPER ZONE ðŸ¤– the volume contained between the floor and a virtual horizontal plane 7" (~17 cm) above the floor in reference to the ROBOT standing normally on a flat floor.
BYPASSED ðŸ¤– any ROBOT which is unable or ineligible to participate in that MATCH as determined by the FTA, LRI, or Head REFEREE resulting in a ROBOT which is disabled.
COACH ðŸ¤– a precollege student or adult mentor member of the DRIVE TEAM responsible for acting as a guide or advisor.
COMPONENT ðŸ¤– any part in its most basic configuration, which cannot be disassembled without damaging or destroying the part or altering its fundamental function.
COTS ðŸ¤– a standard (i.e. not custom order) part commonly available from a VENDOR for all Teams for purchase. To be a COTS item, the COMPONENT or MECHANISM must be in an unaltered, unmodified state.
